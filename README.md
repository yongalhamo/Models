- EDA_covid: preprocess and merge three datasets regarding covid death,covid infection and happiness ratings around the globe to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis.explore corellated features to understand how different features from the happiness dataset affect the covid death and infection rates.

- EDA_sales: univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, correlation analysis and identify and handle duplicate/missing data on sales dataset.

- Mult_Linreg_lifeExp: Implent gradient descent and linear regression without the use of libraries such as scikit learn on the lifeexpectancy dataset.

- PCA_on_iris: conduct basic exploratory data analysis, and create simple data visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib and then,standardize data and apply PCA from scratch. 

- breastcancer_seaborn: Use of statistical data visualization library, Seaborn, to discover and explore the relationships in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data set. Use the results from the exploratory data analysis (EDA) to: drop correlated features, implement feature selection and feature extraction methods including feature selection with correlation, univariate feature selection, recursive feature elimination, principal component analysis (PCA) and tree based feature selection methods and finally  build a boosted decision tree classifier with XGBoost to classify tumors as either malignant or benign. 

- univariate_linreg: implementation of univariate linear regression on bike sharing without using popular libraries.
